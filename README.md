### Some of the things I worked on / learned on this project:

- Implementation of a register / login / google authentication with Firebase
- State managment with React JS and Redux JS
- The use of Redux persist to manage state in local storage so when reload page, the site maintains its state
- Creation of a database in Firebase in order to store:
  - Users and their purchases history
  - Clothes catalog in order by categories
- Implementation of Styled Components Library in order to keep components' styles independent and more flexible
- Implemented SASS library to manage styles (Deleted when implemented Styled Components)
